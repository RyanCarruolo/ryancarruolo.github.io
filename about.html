<h1> About Me </h1>
        
    <p>
        My name is Ryan Carruolo and this is the about me section of my website that I am making for CSC106. <br> 
        I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island, where I am currently trying to decide on a major and the path I want to take. <br>
        before going to "URI" I had gone to Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick Rhode Island. <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy playing Hockey and Lacrosse. aswell as watching them in my free time. My favorite team is the Boston Bruins and I also enjoy watching formula one.
