In this program, my partner Jaed and I created a virtual version of the classic game, “Air Hockey.” Instead of having to leave your home or work, to go to an arcade or place which has an Air Hockey table you can now play the game online with this free program. <br>
Our game has a newer take on other “online” air hockey games. In Jaed and I’s game you are able to play it with a friend or family member, maybe some challenger on the same computer using both the mouse and the keyboard. <br>
Player one is able to control the “red paddle” by using the mouse and move it around without the need to click the screen.<br> 
Player two is able to control the “blue paddle” by using the arrow keys and this allows more than one player to play because they are two different input devices which will not overlap with each other.<br>
The single player mode is not super special as you can just play against a cpu by using the mouse, same as player1.<br> 
The second special feature our game has, is a “soccer gamemode” which allows you to change the design of the game from the classic hockey mode to a new soccer mode.<br>
